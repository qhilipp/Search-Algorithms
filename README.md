# Search Algorithms

## Architecture
All included Search Algorithms rely on the GeneralSearch algorithm, which expands nodes according to a given data structure (e.g. Stack for DepthFirstSearch), evaluates the desireness of nodes according to a heuristic (e.g. Euclidean distance to closest goal for A*). 

## Included concrete Search Algorithms
1. DepthFirstSearch
2. UniformSearch
	- BreadthFirstSearch
3. A\*Search
4. BestFirstSearch
